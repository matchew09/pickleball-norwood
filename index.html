        <p>
          The Norwood Recreation Pickleball League welcomes you to the Fall 2023
          season! <strong>To register for the League</strong>, please visit the
          <a href="/register.html">Register</a> tab and fill out the form: One
          submission per team. If you do not have a team, you may fill the form
          out as a "Free Agent," and we'll assign you to a team after the
          Regristration Period ends. <br /><br /><strong
            >Registration will be open from Wednesday, August 23rd at noon until
            Wednesday, September 13th at noon</strong
          >. <br /><br />In order to register: (step 1/2) You must both fill out the form <strong
          >AND</strong
          > (step 2/2) stop into
          the Norwood Recreation Center to pay your league fee. At this time, we
          do not accept payment online/virtually. The fee to register is $25/person ($50/team).
          <br /><br />
          We currently have space for 12 teams (or 24 players). Spots to the league are first come, first served. Completion of the registration form will not dictate this first-come basis but instead those who complete registration by paying their league fees. <br><br>If the league fills up before you get the chance to join, please still register so we can understand the demand for the league and work to expand for the following season. Also be aware that we will be hosting a Saturday Scramble event during the season (it will take place 9a-12p on September 30th) that will have separate registration. By registering for the league, you will be kept in the loop on when that registration opens up.
