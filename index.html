        <br />

        <p>
          The Norwood Recreation Pickleball League welcomes you to the Fall 2023
          season! <strong>To register for the League</strong>, please visit the
          <a href="/register.html">Register</a> tab for instructions.
          <br /><br /><strong
            >Registration will be open from Friday, August 25th at noon until
            Monday, September 11th at noon.</strong
          >
          <br /><br />
          We currently have space for 12 teams (or 24 players). Spots to the
          league are first come, first serve. The cost to join is $25/person
          ($50/team).
          <br /><br />If the league fills up before you get the chance to join,
          please still register to be weightlisted. Even if spots do not open
          up, we will better understand the demand for the league and work to
          expand for the following season. Plus, we'll be able to make sure you
          get information to register early for the next season.
          <br /><br />Also be aware that we will be hosting a Saturday Scramble
          event during the season. This will take place 9a-12p on September 23rd
          and will have separate registration. More information to come soon!
