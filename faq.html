          <h3 class="faq-question">Question 9: How does the league work?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            The Norwood Recreation Pickleball League is a hosted by the Norwood
            Recreation Department and administered by the league's commissioner.
            For the Fall 2023 season, we will have 12 teams open for
            registration (24 players). <br /><br />
            League play happens 6 straight Wednesdays, starting September 13th
            from 5:30p-8:30p at Waterworks park in Norwood. Each team will play
            three games against other teams in the league. The schedule is setup
            such that you will not have to be present the full time. Expect to
            be playing during a 1.5hour time window.<br /><br />
            When registration closes, you will be assigned a Team number which
            will help you determine your schedule. The schedule will be posted
            on this website indicating each team's timeslots and courts. After
            the 6 weeks wrap up, the season will be concluded. <br /><br />The
            season will also consist of a Saturday Scramble, however
            registration for this event is SEPARATE (it will take place 9a-12p
            on September 23rd). League members will get priority/advanced
            registration for seats in the Scramble event. More information to
            come on the Scramble!
