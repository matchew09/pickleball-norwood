      <h1>The Fall 2024 Schedule TBD</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>The Fall 2024 league season will begin Wednesday, September 11th
          and continue through October 23rd.</strong>
        <br /><br />Your team will be scheduled to play 8-10 games over the
        course of the season, some time between 5:30-9:00p (your games will always
        be lumped together, expect to play during a roughly 1.5 hour window of time).
        <br /><br />
        The schedule will be released indicating all times/matchups by Team
        Number (you will receive this after Registration ends). You may show
        up at 5:30p each week, however, you do not need to arrive until your
        first matchup begins (it's recommended to come a bit early to warm up,
        though).
