          The schedule will also be emailed out via the contact information
          provided at Registration.

            and continue through October 18th.</strong
          >
          <br /><br />Your team will be scheduled to play 3 games (you'll either
          play one game, take a break and then play your other two; or play two
          games, take a break and then play your final game) some time between
          5:30-8:30p (your games will always be lumped together, expect to play
          during a 1.5 hour window of time). <br /><br />
          The schedule will be released indicating all times/matchups by Team
          Number (you will receive this after Registration ends). You may show
          up at 5:30p each week, however, you do not need to arrive until your
          first matchup begins (it's recommended to come a bit early to warm up,
          though).
